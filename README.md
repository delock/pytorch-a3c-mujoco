# pytorch-a3c-mujoco

<p><img src="asset/logo.png" align="middle"></p>

This repo is a fork of a3c for mujoco from https://github.com/andrewliao11/pytorch-a3c-mujoco , enabled for latest mujoco free version (210) and fixed some compatibility bugs.

This code aims to solve some control problems, espicially in Mujoco, and is highly based on [pytorch-a3c](https://github.com/ikostrikov/pytorch-a3c). What's difference between this repo and pytorch-a3c:

- compatible to Mujoco envionments
- the policy network output the mu, and sigma 
- construct a gaussian distribution from mu and sigma
- sample the data from the gaussian distribution
- modify entropy

Note that this repo is only compatible with Mujoco in OpenAI gym. If you want to train agent in Atari domain, please refer to [pytorch-a3c](https://github.com/ikostrikov/pytorch-a3c).

## Usage

There're three tasks/modes for you: train, eval, develop.

At current stage only develop mode is enabled.  Only single worker is supported right now.   Test and checkpoint will be conducted every save_freq iterations

You can choose to display or not using ```display flags```

- develop:
```
python main.py --env-name InvertedPendulum-v2 --task develop --save_freq 1000 --display True
```

In some case that you want to check if you code runs as you want, you might resort to ```pdb```. Here, I provide a develop mode, which only runs in one thread (easy to debug).


## Experiment results

Experiment result of this fork to be added later

### learning curve

The plot of total reward/episode length in 1000 steps:

- InvertedPendulum-v1

![](asset/InvertedPendulum-v1.a3c.log.png)

In InvertedPendulum-v1, total reward exactly equal to episode length.

- InvertedDoublePendulum-v1

![](asset/InvertedDoublePendulum-v1.a3c.log.png)

**Note that the x axis denote the time in minute**

The above curve is plotted from ```python plot.py --log_path ./logs/a3c/InvertedPendulum-v1.a3c.log```

## Requirements
- gym
- mujoco-py
- pytorch
- matplotlib (optional)
- seaborn (optional)

## TODO
I implement the ShareRMSProp in ```my_optim.py```, but I haven't tried it yet.
